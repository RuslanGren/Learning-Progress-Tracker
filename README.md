# Learning progress Tracker

A Java console application that simulates a database for storing information about students and their progress in courses.
The user can add points to students in various courses and track their progress, after collecting the maximum number of points, send them an e-mail informing them that the course has been completed. 
The application also performs some statistics to obtain information, e.g. about the popularity of the course
